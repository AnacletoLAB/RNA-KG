***********************************************************************************
RNA-KG: An ontology-based KG for representing interactions involving RNA molecules
***********************************************************************************

RNA-KG is a knowledge graph encompassing biological knowledge about RNAs gathered from more than 50 public databases, integrating functional relationships with genes, proteins, and chemicals and ontologically grounded biomedical concepts. RNA-KG can be both used by directly exploring and visualizing the KG, and by applying computational methods to analyze and infer bio-medical knowledge. RNA-KG is constantly maintained and updated with new experimental data.

Download Data
=============
RNA-KG is built and maintained using `PheKnowLator <https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator>`_. PheKnowLator requires three documents within the ``resources`` directory to run successfully . Please make sure the documents listed below are presented in the specified location prior to constructing RNA-KG. They can all be accessed at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10078877.


* `resources/resource_info.txt`_
* `resources/ontology_source_list.txt`_
* `resources/edge_source_list.txt`_
* `resources/construction_approach/subclass_construction_map.pkl`
* `resources/knowledge_graphs/PheKnowLator_MergedOntologies.owl`
* `resources/relations_data/RELATIONS_LABELS.txt`
* `resources/relations_data/INVERSE_RELATIONS.txt`

To generate these data yourself, please see the `RNA-KG_Preparation.ipynb`_ and `inteRNA-KG_Preparation.ipynb`_ Jupyter Notebooks.


Construct RNA-KG
================

RNA-KG current release can be generated via the provided `main.ipynb`_ Jupyter Notebook. The adopted PheKnowLator's KG build model is shown below.

.. code:: python

 # PheKnowLator's full build, instance construction approach, with inverse relations, no node metadata, and decode owl (OWL-NETS)
 kg = FullBuild(construction='instance',
                node_data='no',
                inverse_relations='yes',
                decode_owl='yes',
                cpus=psutil.cpu_count(logical=True),
                write_location='./resources/knowledge_graphs')

 kg.construct_knowledge_graph()

Future work
***********

We are currently working on enhancing the proposed KG in different directions.

- Application of Graph Representation Learning methods to analyze RNA-KG.
- Identification of key (nodes and edges') properties associated with RNA molecules and their interactors âžž *Neo4j* endpoint.
- Development of an RNA Ontology with a particular emphasis on non-coding RNA molecules.
- Specification of our meta-graph in terms of LinkML âžž `SPIRES engine (OntoGPT) <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt>`_.
- Development of graphical facilities for supporting the user in the data acquisition process and thus reducing the manual effort required for mapping the data available in the different data sources into RNA-KG.
